# NJTD-CyberPet

I have designed this app with a full stack approach. All you need to do is create a MongoDB cluster and add the details to a .env file, along with SALT_ROUNDS and SECRET. Then from the root directory you can run ./start.sh and both the back and front ends will launch.

Any errors will be console logged for each process for debugging purposes.

I hope anyone who tries this out enjoys it! Feel free to suggest any changes, be them with the code itself, or with new characters or games.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
